# Timelapse Processor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrroach9/TimelapseProcessor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrroach9/TimelapseProcessor)

A tool for processing timelapse photographs into stunning videos. Using computer
vision algorithms, you can get the same effect as those shot with motorized rails --
but without one -- and even better. In the future we planned to provide the following
features:
* Automatic photo alignment
* Emulated camera movement and zooming effect using key-frame based interpolation
* Emulated continuous exposure change
* HDR Timelapse
* EXIF-based timeline management
* Exporting video in multiple formats.

This project is still at an very early stage. We will keep you updated for new progress.
